# Command Line Interface (CLI)

@rspack/cli provides two common subcommands, serve and build, to simplify daily work. If you do not have @rspack/cli installed, please read the Quick Start (/guide/quick-start) section first.

## Build

Run the rspack build command, which will generate the build file in the dist directory.

```sh
$ rspack build # Read the rspack.config.js configuration file by default
$ rspack build -c ./your.config.js
```

## Serve

Running the rspack development server command will start a local development server that will listen for file changes and automatically refresh the browser.

```sh
$ rspack serve
$ rspack serve -c ./your.config.js
```

## Flags

By default rspack provides some common command line arguments, you can see all of them with --help.
